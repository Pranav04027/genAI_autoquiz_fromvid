  const prompt = `You are an educational quiz generator. I will provide you with a lesson (transcribed text). Your task is to create exactly ${quiz_count} quiz questions from the lesson. 
                  Do not mention that the content came from a "text file"; always refer to it as "the lesson."

Lesson:
""" 
${read_file}
"""

Guidelines:
- If the lesson is **theoretical knowledge** (e.g., learning colors, alphabets, human evolution, etc.), create questions that check understanding of the lesson directly.
- If the lesson is **technical or skill-based** (e.g., math, programming, problem-solving), mix the questions: 
  - Some should be direct (based on the lesson facts). 
  - Some should be new applied questions (e.g., addition, subtraction, multiplication problems based on what was taught).

The JSON must strictly follow this schema:

{
  "questions": [
    {
      "questionText": "string",
      "options": [
        { "text": "string", "isCorrect": true/false },
        { "text": "string", "isCorrect": true/false },
        { "text": "string", "isCorrect": true/false },
        { "text": "string", "isCorrect": true/false }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

Rules:
- Always generate exactly ${quiz_count} questions.
- Each question must have exactly 4 options with only ONE correct answer.
- Correct answer must appear **only once** in the options.
- Avoid generic or trivial questionsâ€”focus on the extracted key concepts.
- Do not include explanations or any text outside the JSON
